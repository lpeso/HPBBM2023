This site contains the materials for the *Coding tools for Biochemistry & Molecular Biology* (Herramientas de Programación para Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, a.k.a. **HPBBM**) course of **fall 2023** in the Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry \@[UAM](www.uam.es) (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain). Materials from the **2022** edition are available also [here](https://mredrejo.github.io/HPBBM2022/).

Course Syllabus can be checked at [UAM site](https://secretaria-virtual.uam.es/doa/consultaPublica/look%5Bconpub%5DMostrarPubGuiaDocAs) and a PDF version is available [here](HPBBM_syllabus2023.pdf). Materials from last year are available in the [HPBBM2022 site](https://mredrejo.github.io/HPBBM2022/) and [{{< bi github >}}GitHub repo](https://github.com/mredrejo/HPBBM2022). The course contains a first block of lessons on Python programming (Lessons 1-7) and a Python-vs-R introductory lessons (Lessons R1 & R2) that are not included here. Detailed academic information about the course contents, dates, and assessment only can be found at the [UAM Moodle site](https://moodle.uam.es/).

Each lesson contains embedded interactive exercises (generated with [`learnr`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) y/o [`webexercises`](https://psyteachr.github.io/webexercises/articles/webexercises.html) packages), and a final section of [*R exercises*]{style="color:green"}, some of them from freely available online solved exercises and others that I created. The answers to the latter are not available online, but I'll be glad to provide them upon request.

This site is on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mredrejo/HPBBM2023), containing the source *Quarto files* and the data used in the examples and exercises. The icon [{{< bi cloud-download >}}](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/mredrejo/HPBBM2022/tree/main/data) on the top-right corner in all the site pages will allow you to download the repo **data** folder (link generated with [DownGit](https://yehonal.github.io/DownGit/#/home)). Note tha this folder can be updated during the course.

This is a draft version of this site, but it is intended to be expanded and corrected throughout the next weeks and new versions will be available the following years. Any feedback, help, or suggestions will be very warmly welcome.

Also, it is likely that you find some mistypes or even some big mistakes throughout these course materials. I, and the future students, will appreciate it if you let me know about anything that could be corrected or just improved. You can reach me by [email](mailto::modesto.redrejo@uam.es).
