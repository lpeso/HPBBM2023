## [Wellcome & Disclaimer]{style="color:cornflowerblue"}

This site contains the materials for the *Coding tools for Biochemistry & Molecular Biology* (Herramientas de Programación para Bioquímica y Biología Molecular) course of fall 2022 in the Bachelor's Degree in Biochemistry \@UAM. These materials are available on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mredrejo/HPBBM2022). Detailed academic information about the course contents, dates and assessment only can be found at the UAM Moodle site.

This site contains *R Markdown Notebooks*. When you "knit" the report, R Studio will execute the code within each chunk in the notebook and the results appear beneath the code in the output file (usually HTML or PDF). Check also <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/spin.html> for more info about how to use Notebooks and Markdown. Markdown recently evolved to **Quarto**, which has increased capabilities. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. We will discuss about the use of R Projects, R Markdown and Quarto at the end of this course.

Note that this site is a draft under development and I only expect to have a first complete version by the end of the semester at the earliest (December 2022). Any feedback, help or suggestions will be very warmly welcome.

Also, it is likely that you find some mistypes or even some big mistakes throughout these course materials. I and the future students will appreciate it if you let me know about anything that could be corrected or just improved.
